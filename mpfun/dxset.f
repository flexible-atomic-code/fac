C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   SUBROUTINE  DXSET  MUST BE CALLED PRIOR TO CALLING ANY OTHER
C EXTENDED-RANGE SUBROUTINE. IT CALCULATES AND STORES SEVERAL
C MACHINE-DEPENDENT CONSTANTS IN COMMON BLOCKS. THE USER MUST
C SUPPLY FOUR CONSTANTS THAT PERTAIN TO HIS PARTICULAR COMPUTER.
C THE CONSTANTS ARE
C
C          IRAD = THE INTERNAL BASE OF DOUBLE-PRECISION
C                 ARITHMETIC IN THE COMPUTER.
C        NRADPL = THE NUMBER OF RADIX PLACES CARRIED IN
C                 THE DOUBLE-PRECISION REPRESENTATION.
C         DZERO = THE SMALLEST OF 1/DMIN, DMAX, DMAXLN WHERE
C                 DMIN = THE SMALLEST POSITIVE DOUBLE-PRECISION
C                 NUMBER OR AN UPPER BOUND TO THIS NUMBER,
C                 DMAX = THE LARGEST DOUBLE-PRECISION NUMBER
C                 OR A LOWER BOUND TO THIS NUMBER,
C                 DMAXLN = THE LARGEST DOUBLE-PRECISION NUMBER
C                 SUCH THAT LOG10(DMAXLN) CAN BE COMPUTED BY THE
C                 FORTRAN SYSTEM (ON MOST SYSTEMS DMAXLN = DMAX).
C         NBITS = THE NUMBER OF BITS (EXCLUSIVE OF SIGN) IN
C                 AN INTEGER COMPUTER WORD.
C
C ALTERNATIVELY, ANY OR ALL OF THE CONSTANTS CAN BE GIVEN
C THE VALUE 0 (0.0D0 FOR DZERO). IF A CONSTANT IS ZERO, DXSET TRIES
C TO ASSIGN AN APPROPRIATE VALUE BY CALLING I1MACH
C (SEE P.A.FOX, A.D.HALL, N.L.SCHRYER, ALGORITHM 528 FRAMEWORK
C FOR A PORTABLE LIBRARY, ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATH SOFTWARE,
C V.4, NO.2, JUNE 1978, 177-188).
C
C   THIS IS THE SETTING-UP SUBROUTINE FOR A PACKAGE OF SUBROUTINES
C THAT FACILITATE THE USE OF EXTENDED-RANGE ARITHMETIC. EXTENDED-RANGE
C ARITHMETIC ON A PARTICULAR COMPUTER IS DEFINED ON THE SET OF NUMBERS
C OF THE FORM
C
C               (X,IX) = X*RADIX**IX
C
C WHERE X IS A DOUBLE-PRECISION NUMBER CALLED THE PRINCIPAL PART,
C IX IS AN INTEGER CALLED THE AUXILIARY INDEX, AND RADIX IS THE
C INTERNAL BASE OF THE DOUBLE-PRECISION ARITHMETIC.  OBVIOUSLY,
C EACH REAL NUMBER IS REPRESENTABLE WITHOUT ERROR BY MORE THAN ONE
C EXTENDED-RANGE FORM.  CONVERSIONS BETWEEN  DIFFERENT FORMS ARE
C ESSENTIAL IN CARRYING OUT ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS.  WITH THE CHOICE
C OF RADIX WE HAVE MADE, AND THE SUBROUTINES WE HAVE WRITTEN, THESE
C CONVERSIONS ARE PERFORMED WITHOUT ERROR (AT LEAST ON MOST COMPUTERS).
C (SEE SMITH, J.M., OLVER, F.W.J., AND LOZIER, D.W., EXTENDED-RANGE
C ARITHMETIC AND NORMALIZED LEGENDRE POLYNOMIALS, ACM TRANSACTIONS ON
C MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE, MARCH 1981).
C
C   AN EXTENDED-RANGE NUMBER  (X,IX)  IS SAID TO BE IN ADJUSTED FORM IF
C X AND IX ARE ZERO OR
C
C           RADIX**(-L) .LE. ABS(X) .LT. RADIX**L
C
C IS SATISFIED, WHERE L IS A COMPUTER-DEPENDENT INTEGER DEFINED IN THIS
C SUBROUTINE. TWO EXTENDED-RANGE NUMBERS IN ADJUSTED FORM CAN BE ADDED,
C SUBTRACTED, MULTIPLIED OR DIVIDED (IF THE DIVISOR IS NONZERO) WITHOUT
C CAUSING OVERFLOW OR UNDERFLOW IN THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE RESULT.
C WITH PROPER USE OF THE EXTENDED-RANGE SUBROUTINES, THE ONLY OVERFLOW
C THAT CAN OCCUR IS INTEGER OVERFLOW IN THE AUXILIARY INDEX. IF THIS
C IS DETECTED, THE SOFTWARE CALLS XERROR (A GENERAL ERROR-HANDLING
C FORTRAN SUBROUTINE PACKAGE).
C
C   MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION IS PERFORMED BY SETTING
C
C                 (X,IX)*(Y,IY) = (X*Y,IX+IY)
C OR
C                 (X,IX)/(Y,IY) = (X/Y,IX-IY).
C
C PRE-ADJUSTMENT OF THE OPERANDS IS ESSENTIAL TO AVOID
C OVERFLOW OR  UNDERFLOW OF THE PRINCIPAL PART. SUBROUTINE
C DXADJ (SEE BELOW) MAY BE CALLED TO TRANSFORM ANY EXTENDED-
C RANGE NUMBER INTO ADJUSTED FORM.
C
C   ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION REQUIRE THE USE OF SUBROUTINE DXADD
C (SEE BELOW).  THE INPUT OPERANDS NEED NOT BE IN ADJUSTED FORM.
C HOWEVER, THE RESULT OF ADDITION OR SUBTRACTION IS RETURNED
C IN ADJUSTED FORM.  THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IF (X,IX),(Y,IY),
C (U,IU),  AND (V,IV) ARE IN ADJUSTED FORM, THEN
C
C                 (X,IX)*(Y,IY) + (U,IU)*(V,IV)
C
C CAN BE COMPUTED AND STORED IN ADJUSTED FORM WITH NO EXPLICIT
C CALLS TO DXADJ.
C
C   WHEN AN EXTENDED-RANGE NUMBER IS TO BE PRINTED, IT MUST BE
C CONVERTED TO AN EXTENDED-RANGE FORM WITH DECIMAL RADIX.  SUBROUTINE
C DXCON IS PROVIDED FOR THIS PURPOSE.
C
C   THE SUBROUTINES CONTAINED IN THIS PACKAGE ARE
C
C     SUBROUTINE DXADD
C USAGE
C                  CALL DXADD(X,IX,Y,IY,Z,IZ,IERROR)
C                  IF (IERROR.NE.0) RETURN
C DESCRIPTION
C                  FORMS THE EXTENDED-RANGE SUM  (Z,IZ) =
C                  (X,IX) + (Y,IY).  (Z,IZ) IS ADJUSTED
C                  BEFORE RETURNING. THE INPUT OPERANDS
C                  NEED NOT BE IN ADJUSTED FORM, BUT THEIR
C                  PRINCIPAL PARTS MUST SATISFY
C                  RADIX**(-2L).LE.ABS(X).LE.RADIX**(2L),
C                  RADIX**(-2L).LE.ABS(Y).LE.RADIX**(2L).
C
C     SUBROUTINE DXADJ
C USAGE
C                  CALL DXADJ(X,IX,IERROR)
C                  IF (IERROR.NE.0) RETURN
C DESCRIPTION
C                  TRANSFORMS (X,IX) SO THAT
C                  RADIX**(-L) .LE. ABS(X) .LT. RADIX**L.
C                  ON MOST COMPUTERS THIS TRANSFORMATION DOES
C                  NOT CHANGE THE MANTISSA OF X PROVIDED RADIX IS
C                  THE NUMBER BASE OF DOUBLE-PRECISION ARITHMETIC.
C
C     SUBROUTINE DXC210
C USAGE
C                  CALL DXC210(K,Z,J,IERROR)
C                  IF (IERROR.NE.0) RETURN
C DESCRIPTION
C                  GIVEN K THIS SUBROUTINE COMPUTES J AND Z
C                  SUCH THAT  RADIX**K = Z*10**J, WHERE Z IS IN
C                  THE RANGE 1/10 .LE. Z .LT. 1.
C                  THE VALUE OF Z WILL BE ACCURATE TO FULL
C                  DOUBLE-PRECISION PROVIDED THE NUMBER
C                  OF DECIMAL PLACES IN THE LARGEST
C                  INTEGER PLUS THE NUMBER OF DECIMAL
C                  PLACES CARRIED IN DOUBLE-PRECISION DOES NOT
C                  EXCEED 60. DXC210 IS CALLED BY SUBROUTINE
C                  DXCON WHEN NECESSARY. THE USER SHOULD
C                  NEVER NEED TO CALL DXC210 DIRECTLY.
C
C     SUBROUTINE DXCON
C USAGE
C                  CALL DXCON(X,IX,IERROR)
C                  IF (IERROR.NE.0) RETURN
C DESCRIPTION
C                  CONVERTS (X,IX) = X*RADIX**IX
C                  TO DECIMAL FORM IN PREPARATION FOR
C                  PRINTING, SO THAT (X,IX) = X*10**IX
C                  WHERE 1/10 .LE. ABS(X) .LT. 1
C                  IS RETURNED, EXCEPT THAT IF
C                  (ABS(X),IX) IS BETWEEN RADIX**(-2L)
C                  AND RADIX**(2L) THEN THE REDUCED
C                  FORM WITH IX = 0 IS RETURNED.
C
C     SUBROUTINE DXRED
C USAGE
C                  CALL DXRED(X,IX,IERROR)
C                  IF (IERROR.NE.0) RETURN
C DESCRIPTION
C                  IF
C                  RADIX**(-2L) .LE. (ABS(X),IX) .LE. RADIX**(2L)
C                  THEN DXRED TRANSFORMS (X,IX) SO THAT IX=0.
C                  IF (X,IX) IS OUTSIDE THE ABOVE RANGE,
C                  THEN DXRED TAKES NO ACTION.
C                  THIS SUBROUTINE IS USEFUL IF THE
C                  RESULTS OF EXTENDED-RANGE CALCULATIONS
C                  ARE TO BE USED IN SUBSEQUENT ORDINARY
C                  DOUBLE-PRECISION CALCULATIONS.

C FOLLOWING CODING PREVENTS DXSET FROM BEING EXECUTED MORE THAN ONCE.
C THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOME SUBROUTINES (SUCH AS DXNRMP AND
