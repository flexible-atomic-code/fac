/*************************************************************
  Header for module "rcfp".
  This module calculates the reduced coefficients of fractional
  parentage, the reduced matrix elements of creation, and
  annihilation operators between the single subshell states.

  It is mainly translated from the F90 package of 
  Gaigalas et al. CPC 139 (2001) 263.
