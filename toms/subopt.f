c
c irepl, ifxsw, and bonus deal with measurement replication.
c Objective functions subject to large amounts of noise can
c cause an optimization method to halt at a false optimum.
c An expensive solution to this problem is to evaluate f
c several times at each point and return the average (or max
c or min) of these trials as the function value.  subplx
c performs measurement replication only at the current best
c point. The longer a point is retained as best, the more
c accurate its function value becomes.
c
c The common variable nfxe contains the number of function
c evaluations at the current best point. fxstat contains the
c mean, max, min, and standard deviation of these trials.
c
c irepl  - measurement replication switch
c irepl  = 0, 1, or 2
c        = 0 : no measurement replication
c        = 1 : subplx performs measurement replication
c        = 2 : user performs measurement replication
c              (This is useful when optimizing on the mean,
c              max, or min of trials is insufficient. Common
c              variable initx is true for first function
c              evaluation. newx is true for first trial at
c              this point. The user uses subroutine fstats
c              within his objective function to maintain
c              fxstat. By monitoring newx, the user can tell
c              whether to return the function evaluation
c              (newx = .true.) or to use the new function
c              evaluation to refine the function evaluation
c              of the current best point (newx = .false.).
c              The common variable ftest gives the function
c              value that a new point must beat to be
c              considered the new best point.)
c
      irepl = 0
c
c ifxsw  - measurement replication optimization switch
c ifxsw  = 1, 2, or 3
c        = 1 : retain mean of trials as best function value
c        = 2 : retain max
c        = 3 : retain min
c
      ifxsw = 1
c
c Since the current best point will also be the most
c accurately evaluated point whenever irepl .gt. 0, a bonus
c should be added to the function value of the best point
c so that the best point is not replaced by a new point
c that only appears better because of noise.
c subplx uses bonus to determine how many multiples of
c fxstat(4) should be added as a bonus to the function
c evaluation. (The bonus is adjusted automatically by
c subplx when ifxsw or minf is changed.)
c
c bonus  - measurement replication bonus coefficient
c          bonus .ge. 0 (normally, bonus = 0 or 1)
c        = 0 : bonus not used
c        = 1 : bonus used
c
      bonus = 1.d0
c
c nfstop = 0 : f(x) is not tested against fstop
c        = 1 : if f(x) has reached fstop, subplx returns
c              iflag = 2
c        = 2 : (only valid when irepl .gt. 0)
c              if f(x) has reached fstop and
c              nfxe .gt. nfstop, subplx returns iflag = 2
c
      nfstop = 0
c
c fstop  - f target value
c          Its usage is determined by the value of nfstop.
c
c minf   - logical switch
c        = .true.  : subplx performs minimization
c        = .false. : subplx performs maximization
c
      minf = .true.
      return
