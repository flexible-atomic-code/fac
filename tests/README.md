# How to test

## Python module

### Preparation

We need `pytest` and `pytest-xdist`.
Install them via
```bash
conda install pytest pytest-xdist
```
for anaconda distribution or
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-xdist
```
for python native environment.

Run `run_pytest.sh`
```bash
./tests/run_pytest.sh
```
